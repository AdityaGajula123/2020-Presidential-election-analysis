# 2020-Presidential-election-analysis
This project aims to do sentiment analysis of political views of Twitter users during the 2020 American Presidential Election campaign. This is an important study as public opinion for a particular candidate will impact the potential leader of the country. We are relying on Twitter as it acquires a large diverse data set representing the current public opinion about President Trump.  
The business objective of this project is to analyze the following questions:  
• What is the public sentiment distribution across the various locations/ states in the U.S.?  
• Which states require more strategic campaigning/ awareness by the Trump Government?  
• Does the positivity of a tweet influence the quantity of retweets/favorites?
We performed the analysis to study the current state of public opinions.
